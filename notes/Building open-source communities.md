Some questions
		- What defines a “healthy” ecosystem for a library/package? 
		- How important is it for a library too /clearly/ define its mental models and terminology (it seems quite unifying?)? 
		- What is a healthy push/pull relationship between the library and its ecosystem? 
		- Should a library stay low-level and unopinionated so that the ecosystem can innovate? 
		- How does a library gain trust in a consumer that it can scale to non-trivial use cases?
